Exercise

## Exercise 4 (JULIA)

1. Create two matrices of the same layout and test if addition and subtraction of the matrix works as expected: C = A + B

2. Now compare matrix multiplication either this way A * B and this way A .* B. Whats the difference?!

3. What about matrix division with "/" or "\"?!

4. Create a 3x3 integer matrix A with useful numbers. Now try A+1, A-1, A*2, A/2.

5. Now multiply a 3x4 matrix with a suitable (4)vector.
